## How These Playbooks Are Used

These playbooks are intended for use by on-call security engineers during active incidents.

Typical usage:
1. An alert, detection, or user report triggers initial triage.
2. The relevant playbook is referenced to guide:
   - immediate containment actions
   - investigation priorities
   - communication steps
3. Actions and findings are documented using the provided templates.
4. Lessons learned are used to improve detections, controls, and response readiness.

The playbooks prioritize clarity and speed under real-world incident pressure.
