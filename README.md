# Incident Response Playbooks

## Purpose
This repository contains practical incident response playbooks focused on identity, endpoint, and privilege-related security incidents. The goal is to provide clear, actionable response steps that support rapid triage, containment, and recovery.

## Scope
- Identity compromise and MFA abuse
- OAuth consent and token theft
- Endpoint malware and EDR alerts
- Privileged account misuse

## What this is NOT
- Not a theoretical framework
- Not a NIST copy/paste
- Not vendor-specific runbooks

These playbooks reflect real-world response decision-making under time pressure.


## How These Playbooks Are Used

These playbooks are intended for use by on-call security engineers during active incidents.

Typical usage:
1. An alert, detection, or user report triggers initial triage.
2. The relevant playbook is referenced to guide:
   - immediate containment actions
   - investigation priorities
   - communication steps
3. Actions and findings are documented using the provided templates.
4. Lessons learned are used to improve detections, controls, and response readiness.

The playbooks prioritize clarity and speed under real-world incident pressure.
