# Incident Response Playbooks

## Purpose
This repository contains practical incident response playbooks focused on identity, endpoint, and privilege-related security incidents. The goal is to provide clear, actionable response steps that support rapid triage, containment, and recovery.

## Scope
- Identity compromise and MFA abuse
- OAuth consent and token theft
- Endpoint malware and EDR alerts
- Privileged account misuse

## What this is NOT
- Not a theoretical framework
- Not a NIST copy/paste
- Not vendor-specific runbooks

These playbooks reflect real-world response decision-making under time pressure.
